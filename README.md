This is my attempt at the Odin Project's To-Do List project. I call it To-Do Wizard and it uses local storage to keep project data across sessions.

Users start with a default project that can be used to add unsorted tasks to begin with, but users can add, edit, and delete projects as needed. Tasks are added to projects and can be edited or deleted as well.
